Error - axios cors and xml handle - make sure you have added the CrossOrigin annotation at the top of the class and make sure your request map and headings are correct and the base url in the react service file matches the path in your request mappings

SideNote - We don't want an admin registration page because we don't want anyone to just be able to go on the website and register an admin account - an admin account must be set manually in the db

IMPORTANT
Key Idea is that whenever you are creating a var that relies on fetched data you need to make it a state variable because initially all the values of that var will be null and if a non state var then the component will not rerender when the var is actually populated with data - state variables will cause component to rerender when their value is updated
//we need to set coach(anything that relies on async function) to be a state var because it will initially be null but when updated it will rerender the component
//if we set const coach = CoachServce.getCoachById(id)... then we would have all null values rendered at first and when it finally was set equal to something the component would not rerender because it is not a state var

Error - Remember to use .equals with string and NOT ==

Error - When you see something briefly in the console and it goes away you need to add e.preventDefault(); at the beginning of the 
method that is called on submit and also accept the event as a parameter like const methodName = (e) =>{e.preventDefault(); ...}

YOU MUST HAVE GET METHODS FOR ALL YOUR ATTRIBUTES IF YOU WANT THEM RETURNED WHEN YOU QUERY THE DB
